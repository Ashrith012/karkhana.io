# Möbius Strip Modeling - Assignment Write-up

## Code Structure

To keep things clean and modular, the implementation uses an object-oriented approach by wrapping all logic inside a `MobiusStrip` class. Here's a breakdown of how it's organized:

1. **Initialization**: The constructor takes three inputs—radius (R), strip half-width (w), and the number of subdivisions (n)—to set up the parameter grid.

2. **Core Methods**:
   - `compute_points()`: Generates the 3D coordinates for the entire strip using parametric equations.

   - `parametric_point()`: Computes a single point on the strip for given parameter values.

   - `parametric_derivatives()`: Calculates the partial derivatives of the parametric equations, which are needed to compute surface area.

   - `surface_area_element()`: Uses the cross product of the derivatives to calculate the infinitesimal surface area.

   - `compute_surface_area()`: Numerically integrates these area elements across the surface.

   - `compute_edge_length()`: Calculates the total length of the strip’s boundary.

   - `visualize()`: Plots a 3D model of the strip for better understanding.

3. **Main Function**: Demonstrates the class in action—instantiating the object, calculating properties, and visualizing the Möbius strip.

## Surface Area Approximation

To calculate the surface area, I used a method based on the mathematics of parametric surfaces:

1. **Concept**: For any parametric surface, the area is given by the integral of the magnitude of the cross product of its partial derivatives.

2. **How it was done**:
   - For each (u, v) point, compute the partial derivatives ∂r/∂u and ∂r/∂v.

   - Take their cross product to get the normal vector at that point.

   - The magnitude of that vector gives the local surface area element.

   - Use SciPy’s dblquad to integrate these magnitudes across the full parameter domain.

This numerical approach gave accurate results without having to manually split the surface into triangles or quads.

## Edge Length Calculation

Even though the Möbius strip has only one edge, calculating its length isn't entirely straightforward:

   - I fixed `v = w/2` to stay along the edge and varied `u` from 0 to 4π (you need two full rotations to trace the edge completely).

   - Then I sampled several points along this path.

   - Finally, I added up the distances between consecutive points to get the total edge length.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Getting the Surface Area Right**: Setting up the integral was tricky. The math behind the partial derivatives and the integration bounds needed to be carefully verified to avoid errors in the final area.

2. **Understanding the Strip’s Topology**: Realizing that the Möbius strip has just one continuous edge that takes 4π to traverse was crucial for correctly calculating the edge length.

3. **Visualization Tweaks**:

   - Choosing colors and shading that clearly show the twist and one-sided surface of the strip was important.

   - I also had to highlight the edge so that the "one boundary" property is visually obvious.

   - Adjusting camera angles made the twist easier to interpret in 3D.

4. **PParameter Resolution**: Too few points would miss out on the strip’s geometry, while too many would slow things down. So, balancing accuracy and performance was another small hurdle.

The implementation successfully addresses these challenges while maintaining code clarity and efficiency.
